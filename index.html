        Mount Rainier is an iconic mountain located in Washington State, USA. Standing at 14,411 feet 
        (4,392 meters), it is the highest peak in the Cascade Range and serves as a stunning backdrop 
        to the Seattle-Tacoma area. The mountain's glaciers provide water to the region, supporting both 
        wildlife and human communities. Its striking appearance has made it a significant landmark for 
        explorers, nature lovers, and scientists studying its geological activity.

      <h2>Geology and Formation</h2>
      <p>
        Mount Rainier is an active stratovolcano formed through repeated eruptions of andesitic lava. 
        It has over 26 major glaciers, making it one of the most heavily glaciated peaks in the contiguous 
        United States. The mountain's volcanic activity has shaped its rugged terrain, creating deep 
        valleys, ridges, and river basins. Geologists closely monitor Rainier for potential future eruptions, 
        as it poses a significant threat due to its proximity to densely populated areas.

      <h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
      <p>
        Mount Rainier National Park is home to a diverse range of plant and animal species. The lower 
        elevations feature temperate rainforests with towering Douglas fir, western hemlock, and red 
        cedar trees. Wildflower meadows bloom in mid-summer, including species like lupine, Indian 
        paintbrush, and avalanche lilies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wildlife in the region includes black bears, elk, and mountain goats. Black bears are commonly 
        seen foraging for berries and insects, while elk migrate through the valleys in herds. Mountain 
        goats, adapted to the rocky cliffs, are skilled climbers often spotted on steep slopes. Smaller 
        species like marmots, pikas, and foxes also inhabit the alpine regions.

      <h2>Glaciers</h2>
      <p>
        Mount Rainier is home to some of the largest glaciers in the continental United States. The 
        Emmons Glacier, covering approximately 4.3 square miles, is the largest by area. The Carbon 
        Glacier, on the other hand, is the thickest glacier in the U.S. at 700 feet deep. These glaciers 
        play a crucial role in regulating water flow to surrounding rivers, which provide fresh water 
        for both wildlife and human use. Climate change has led to significant glacial retreat in recent 
        decades, raising concerns about future water availability.

      <h2>Recreational Opportunities</h2>
      <p>
        Mount Rainier National Park offers a variety of outdoor activities for adventurers. Hiking 
        trails range from short scenic walks to strenuous backcountry routes. The Wonderland Trail, 
        a 93-mile loop around the mountain, provides breathtaking views of glaciers, waterfalls, and 
        alpine meadows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Climbing Mount Rainier is a challenging endeavor that attracts thousands of climbers each year. 
        Due to unpredictable weather and crevasse hazards, summiting requires proper gear and 
        mountaineering experience. In winter, the park offers skiing, snowshoeing, and ice climbing 
        opportunities.
